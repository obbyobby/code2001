# Assessment 2

This is the github repository for my 2001 coursework as a part of the University of Plymouth.

I have created a database that provides the profile microservice for a walking trail app. I have used visual studio to link the database to RESTful API.
To create the database, I used Azure Data Studio.

Users can be added, updated, read, and deleted. They can only be deleted by admins.
Users can also create trails to add to the application, as well as add reviews and photos.
